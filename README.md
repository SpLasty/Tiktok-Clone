Mostly playing around with Nestjs and GraphQL

To set up:

1) Npm I in both the directories

2) Replace the variables for the Database name, password, and username in docker-compose.yml with your setup.

3) Create your own secret key for Refresh and Access Tokens in an env file

4) Run docker-compose up -d

5) npm start run: dev on backend directory and npm run dev for frontend
